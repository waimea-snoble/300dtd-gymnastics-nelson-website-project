## Addressing Relevant Implications

### Functionality

I tested all the main features such as registering, logging in, adding, deleting, and signing up for tasks. I also made sure that only the correct password would work when logging in to ensure the features all worked well without any bugs. Now, each function should work as intended.


### Useability

I addressed this implication by following most of Neilsen's useability heuristics. I made sure the website design was consistent throughout every page as well as telling them when their username or password is incorrect when logging in. I also added a feature where the user can view all of the tasks they have signed uop for so they don't have to remember them and telling them if a page couldn't be found.


### Aesthetics

I addressed "aesthetics" by talking to my client about what colours to use to ensure that the website is the most aesthetically pleasing. We decided on a clean blue ans white theme to make the website look simple but professional, as well as making sure the font i used was easy to read.


### Social

I addressed this implication by not using any language or design choices that could cause offense to any group of people.


### Privacy

I addressed this by keeping all of the users information in a database as well as making sure the password is stored as a password hash so even if the database is breached, their passwords are safe. I also made sure that information such as the user's contact details can only be accessed by the admin.


### Accessability

I addressed this implication by making sure it can be used on a variety of devices, I did this by changing the size of the window to replicate the size of phones and ipads. I used a simple easy to read font and made sure buttons could be clicked easily, this made sure my website is accessible for everyone

## Overall Review

Overall my project went really well, i was able to create a fully functional website for Gymnastics Nelson where users can create an account, login and sign up for tasks.
- The design process of my project went really well as my client was very clear in how they wanted the website to function and look
- Something that didn't go well was the communication with the client because they had to speak to the committee and then tell me what they said. This was frustrating as i had to wait for feedback instead of receiving it immediately
- The testing helped me find any bugs with the website to make sure a user can fully use it without any issues. Speaking to my client also helped me finalise the design, functionality and the website as a whole.
- Something I would do differently would be to not have one client, but to preset it in front of the whole gymnastics committee so that I could get multiple ideas and the website will be exactly what the team wants.
