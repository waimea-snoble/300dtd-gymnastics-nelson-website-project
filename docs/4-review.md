# Project Review

## Addressing Relevant Implications

### Functionality

I tested all the main features such as registering, logging in, adding, deleting, and signing up for tasks to ensure they all worked well without any bugs. Now, each function should work as intended.


### Useability

I addressed this implication by following most of Neilsen's useability heuristics. I made sure the website design was consistent throughout every page as well as telling them when their username or password is incorrect when logging in. I also added a feature where the user can view all of the tasks they have signed uop for so they don't have to remember them and telling them if a page couldn't be found.


### Aesthetics

I addressed "aesthetics" by talking to my client about what colours to use to ensure that the website is the most aesthetically pleasing.


### Social

Replace this text with notes about what you did during the project to address the implication - design features, etc.


### Privacy

I addressed this by keeping all of the users information in a database as well as making sure the password is stored as a password hash so even if the database is breached, their passwords are safe.


### Accessability

Replace this text with not4es about what you did during the project to address the implication - design features, etc.

## Overall Review

Replace these words with a brief review of how the project went in terms of:
- What went well?
- What didn't go so well?
- How did the testing/trialling impact the final system?
- What would you do differently if you could?
