# Project Review

## Addressing Relevant Implications

### Functionality

I tested all the main features such as registering, logging in, adding, deleting, and signing up for tasks. I also made sure that only the correct password would work when logging in to ensure the features all worked well without any bugs. Now, each function should work as intended.


### Useability

I addressed this implication by following most of Neilsen's useability heuristics. I made sure the website design was consistent throughout every page as well as telling them when their username or password is incorrect when logging in. I also added a feature where the user can view all of the tasks they have signed uop for so they don't have to remember them and telling them if a page couldn't be found.


### Aesthetics

I addressed "aesthetics" by talking to my client about what colours to use to ensure that the website is the most aesthetically pleasing. We decided on a clean blue ans white theme to make the website look simple but professional, as well as making sure the font i used was easy to read.


### Social

I addressed this implication by not using any language or design choices that could cause offense to any group of people.


### Privacy

I addressed this by keeping all of the users information in a database as well as making sure the password is stored as a password hash so even if the database is breached, their passwords are safe. I also made sure that information such as the user's contact details can only be accessed by the admin.


### Accessability

Replace this text with not4es about what you did during the project to address the implication - design features, etc.

## Overall Review

Replace these words with a brief review of how the project went in terms of:
- What went well?
- What didn't go so well?
- How did the testing/trialling impact the final system?
- What would you do differently if you could?
