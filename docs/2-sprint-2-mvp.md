## Testing Volunteer/Un volunteer

I am testing what happens when a user volunteers and un volunteers for a task. When volunteering, a new item is created in the volunteer table in the database and the signed up value in the task table is increased by one. When the user un volunteers the signed up value in the tasks table decreases by one and the volunteer item in the volunteers table is deleted.

## Testing Volunteer/un volunteer when the signed up amount reaches the required amount

I am testing what happens when a user signs up for a taskl that is about to reach the required amount. The task dissapears from the home page but is still in their personal list and in the database the signed up amount increases and a new volunteer is made. When the user un volunteers from the task it reappears on the home page and the signed up amount decreases by one and the volunteer is deleted.

## Sprint Review

This sprint moved the project forward by turning it into a functional website. The main features such as registering a user, adding and deleting tasks and there were some small bugs but were fixed easily. Now the website is ready for a final polish in sprint 3.
