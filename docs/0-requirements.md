# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

Replace this text with a clearly stated problem or need that exists that your project will attempt to solve / fulfil.

At Gymnastics Nelson all of the volunteering for events is done on peice of paper, where people have to manually write their contact details every time they want to volunteer for something. I will solve this by making a website that each user can log into and save their information so that they don't need to input it every time.

## End-User Requirements

Replace this text with a description of your typical end-users and their specific needs / expectations / requirements.

My end users could be people of all ages, ranging from gymnasts comepeting in the events, or parents, grandparents, caregivers, or siblings who want to help out. 

## Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.

I intend to solve this problem by making a website where the users can log in and volunteer for tasks easily, the users will be able to see only the tasks that they have signed up for, as well as having a personal check list for them to know which tasks they have already completed. The admin can also log in with their own username and password to see who has signed up for each task. The admin can also add/delete tasks if new ones are required, or old ones are no longer needed.
