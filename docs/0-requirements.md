# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

At Gymnastics Nelson all of the volunteering for events is done on peice of paper, where people have to manually write their contact details every time they want to volunteer for something. I will solve this by making a website that each user can log into and save their information so that they don't need to input it every time.

## End-User Requirements

My end users could be people of all ages, ranging from gymnasts comepeting in the events, or parents, grandparents, caregivers, or siblings who want to help out. 

## Proposed Solution

I intend to solve this problem by making a website where the users can log in and volunteer for tasks easily, the users will be able to see only the tasks that they have signed up for, as well as having a personal check list for them to know which tasks they have already completed. The admin can also log in with their own username and password to see who has signed up for each task. The admin can also add/delete tasks if new ones are required, or old ones are no longer needed.
