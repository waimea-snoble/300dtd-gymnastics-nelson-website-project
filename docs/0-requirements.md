# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

At Gymnastics Nelson all of the volunteering for events is done on peice of paper, where people have to manually write their contact details every time they want to volunteer for something. I will solve this by making a website that each user can log into and save their information so that they don't need to input it every time.

## End-User Requirements

My end users could be people of all ages, ranging from gymnasts comepeting in the events, or parents, grandparents, caregivers, or siblings who want to help out. 

## Proposed Solution

I intend to solve this problem by making a website where the users can log in and volunteer for tasks easily, the users will be able to see only the tasks that they have signed up for, as well as having a personal check list for them to know which tasks they have already completed. The admin can also log in with their own username and password to see who has signed up for each task. The admin can also add/delete tasks if new ones are required, or old ones are no longer needed.

# Relevant Implications

## Fuctionality

Funcionality means that the website does everything as intended, wont crash, has no bugs, and matches the purpose of the website I am creating.

### Relevance to the System

Fuctionality should be relevant to every project because if it doesn't function as intended. the end-user might have a hard time navigating each page.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to be constantly checking for bugs throughout the creation of the website so that it always functions well and i wont need to check back on my code to figure out whats wrong. This will make the process a lot easier for me as well as keeping the website functional for the user



## Usability

Useability means making a website that is easy to use by following Nielsen's 10 useability heuristics

### Relevance to the System

This is relevant for my project because the end user could be any age, meaning that the website needs to be easy to use. This will be done by referring to the 10 useability heuristics when designing my website.

### Impact / Considerations

To make sure the website is easy to use, i will have simple instructions, keeping the layout clean and consistent as well as making the pages easy to navigate through. This will make the website more enjoyable for the user



## Aesthetics


Aesthetics means having a good design that appeals to the user by using a good combination of colours that isn't hard to look at, putting everything in a good position and making sure I use good fonts.

### Relevance to the System


This is relevant to my project because if the user doesn't like how it looks or the colour pattern is hard to look at, thet might not want to use the website anymore

### Impact / Considerations

I will be making a draft of what the colours in the website will look like and test them with my client. This will ensure that i have chosen a good colour scheme without having to rewrite all of the code if it looks bad.



## Social

Social means having a project that appeals to all groups and doesn't cause offence to anyone

### Relevance to the System

This is important for my project because I want the website to appeal to all coaches, gymnasts and caregivers, taking into consideration their age, gender and ethnicity.

### Impact / Considerations

Moving forward I will need to make sure that my design choices and words are not offensive to anyone. This will make my website feel safe fore everyone to use.



## Privacy

Privacy means keeping the users information safe and making sure any private data that is collected, is not shared with anyone.

### Relevance to the System

This is important for my project because people will be logging in using usernames and passwords, so this information will need to be protected.

### Impact / Considerations

I will make sure that the users data is stored securely in a database. I will also be using a password hashing system so that if the data base is accessed, the users passwords are safe. This is important because if the website is not safe, the user's data could get leaked.

## Accessability

Accessability means that any user can use the website, wether they have different devices or have different experience using websites.

### Relevance to the System

This is important to my project because there will be a range of people using it, from the gymnasts themselves to their grandparents with different ages and abilities.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to make sure that the website functions correctly on a range of devices, as well as making the website easy to navigate, having simple instructions, and simple language so anyone of any age can understand it. This will make the website accessible to anyone, regardless of age or device.
